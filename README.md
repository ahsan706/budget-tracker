# budget-tracker
It is my playground for trying new technologies, learn and have fun.
More this project is FullStack project using yarn workspaces. It is using express.js as backend and react as front end.
Material Ui is used to add professional look to whole application.
Code is consistent and standard is maintained by prettier and eslint.
Husky is added to automatically detect any sub standard code from been pushed. Auto fixable issues are added to commit automatically for convenience.
Want to add translations to the application with accessibility feature.

Future plan is to add more features in it. Make it more of real fullstack Application. More with CI/CD. With more deployment by code pushes.
